          <p>
            I have spent most my life gaming and following the next big thing in
            technology. Since I can remember, whenever I saw someone working
            with computers and writing code, I was fascinated. I've gone about
            and tried other things but something always drew me back to the idea
            of writing code and making something from nothing. Now i'm finally
            turning that in a reality. I had the opportunity to work on radios
            and various electronic systems while serving in the military. This
            has given me a solid foundation for problem solving, fast thinking,
            being able to adapt to any circumstance and still produce the best
            product I can in those circumstances. Now I am on a new path forging
            a career in Software Development. I don't know where it will lead
            me, but I am excited for the journey.
