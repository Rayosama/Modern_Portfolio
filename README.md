This is an on-going personal project, used to display myself and some of my work. If you have any recommendations please let me know, as they are highly encouraged! Whether it is adding a new feature, or a more efficient way to re-write my code to condense it, whatever you can think of. I appreciate your time and thank you for looking at my code!
